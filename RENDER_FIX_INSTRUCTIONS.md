# 🚀 URGENT: Fix Render Deployment 

## ⚠️ ISSUE CONFIRMED
Your Render deployment is running `render-server.js` instead of `comprehensive-backend.js`

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### 1. Update Render Dashboard Settings

**Login to render.com and find your `consenthub-backend` service**

**Current Settings (WRONG):**
```
Start Command: node backend/render-server.js
Root Directory: /
Build Command: npm install
```

**Required Settings (CORRECT):**
```
Start Command: node comprehensive-backend.js
Root Directory: (leave empty or set to ".")  
Build Command: npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables to Verify
Make sure these are set in Render:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://consentuser:12345@consentcluster.ylmrqgl.mongodb.net/consentDB
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
CORS_ORIGIN=https://consent-management-system-api.vercel.app
```

### 3. Repository Settings to Check
- **Repository:** Should point to ConsentHub-Frontend
- **Branch:** feature/Deployment (or main after merge)
- **Auto-Deploy:** Enabled

### 4. After Making Changes
1. Click **"Manual Deploy"**
2. Select **"Deploy latest commit"** 
3. Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)

### 5. Test After Deployment
Run this command to verify:
```bash
node check-backend-version.js
```

**Expected output after fix:**
```
✅ Running comprehensive-backend.js
📋 Available endpoints:
  - /api/v1/privacy-notices ✅
  - /api/v1/admin/dashboard/overview ✅  
  - /api/guardians ✅
  - /api/v1/dsar/requests ✅
  - ... (and many more)
```

## 🚨 WHY THIS HAPPENED

Your Render service was likely:
1. Set up initially with `render-server.js`
2. Never updated to use the comprehensive backend
3. Ignoring the `render.yaml` configuration file

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS AFTER FIX

Once the backend is fixed, ALL these console errors will disappear:
- ✅ WebSocket connections will work
- ✅ All admin dashboard endpoints will work  
- ✅ Customer consent management will work
- ✅ DSAR requests will work
- ✅ Real-time updates will work

**The frontend is perfect - it's just talking to the wrong backend!**
