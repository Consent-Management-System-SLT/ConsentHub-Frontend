# WHY YOU STILL SEE DOUBLED ENDPOINTS IN CONSOLE

## The Problem
Even after fixing the code, you still see:
- `/api/v1/consent/consent`
- `/api/v1/preference/preference`
- `/api/v1/party/party`
- `/api/v1/dsar/dsar`

## Root Cause: BROWSER CACHE
Your browser cached the OLD JavaScript files and refuses to load the NEW ones!

## Evidence
Look at your browser's Network tab - you'll see:
- `index-B4tCQX_m.js` (OLD cached file)
- NOT loading the new corrected JavaScript

## COMPLETE CACHE CLEAR SOLUTION

### Step 1: Nuclear Cache Clear
```
Chrome/Edge:
1. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Check Network tab - should see NEW JavaScript files loading
```

### Step 2: Manual Cache Clear
```
Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear Browsing Data → "All time"
- Check "Cached images and files"
- Check "Cookies and site data"
- Click "Clear data"
```

### Step 3: Disable Cache (While Testing)
```
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache" checkbox
4. Refresh page
```

### Step 4: Incognito Test
```
1. Open Incognito/Private window
2. Visit your site
3. Check console - should show correct endpoints
```

### Step 5: Force New Build (If Nothing Works)
```
1. Make any small change to trigger new build
2. Redeploy to Vercel
3. New files will have different names/hashes
```

## What You Should See After Cache Clear
✅ `/api/v1/consent` (not doubled)
✅ `/api/v1/preference` (not doubled)  
✅ `/api/v1/party` (not doubled)
✅ `/api/v1/dsar` (not doubled)

## Quick Test
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// This will show if cache is cleared
console.log('Cache test:', Date.now());
```

If you see the same timestamp after refresh, cache isn't cleared!

## Nuclear Option: Different Browser
Try a different browser (Firefox, Edge, Safari) to confirm the fix works.
