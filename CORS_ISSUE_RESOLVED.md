# CORS Issue Resolution - Vercel Deployment

## Problem
Your ConsentHub frontend deployed on Vercel (`https://consent-management-system-api.vercel.app`) was unable to make requests to your local development services due to CORS policy restrictions.

## Error Details
- **Error Type**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Policy Violation
- **Error Message**: "Access to XMLHttpRequest has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"
- **Root Cause**: Local services were only configured to accept requests from localhost origins, not from the Vercel deployment domain

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Auth Service CORS Configuration
**File**: `simple-auth-server.js`
- Added Vercel domain to allowed origins: `'https://consent-management-system-api.vercel.app'`
- Updated both the main CORS middleware and preflight handlers

### 2. Updated All Mock Services CORS Configuration
**Files Updated**:
- `mock-customer-service.js`
- `mock-consent-service.js`
- `mock-preference-service.js`
- `mock-privacy-notice-service.js`
- `mock-dsar-service.js`
- `mock-event-service.js`

### 3. CORS Configuration Details
```javascript
cors({
    origin: [
        'http://localhost:5173', 
        'http://localhost:5174', 
        'http://localhost:5175', 
        'http://localhost:3000',
        'https://consent-management-system-api.vercel.app'  // Added this
    ],
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With', 'Accept', 'Origin']
})
```

## Services Status (Post-Fix)
✅ **Auth Service** - Port 3008 - Running with updated CORS
✅ **Customer Service** - Port 3011 - Running with updated CORS
✅ **Consent Service** - Port 3012 - Running with updated CORS
✅ **Preference Service** - Port 3013 - Running with updated CORS
✅ **Privacy Notice Service** - Port 3014 - Running with updated CORS
✅ **DSAR Service** - Port 3015 - Running with updated CORS
✅ **Event Service** - Port 3016 - Running with updated CORS

## Testing
- Auth service health check: ✅ `http://localhost:3008/api/v1/auth/health`
- Customer service health check: ✅ `http://localhost:3011/health`

## Next Steps
1. **Test Registration**: Try registering a new user from the Vercel frontend
2. **Test Login**: Try logging in with existing credentials
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check browser developer console for any remaining CORS issues

## Important Notes
- All local services now accept requests from both localhost (development) and Vercel (production)
- Services were restarted with the new CORS configuration
- The CORS fix allows your deployed frontend to communicate with local backend services for testing

## For Production Deployment
When you deploy the backend services to production:
1. Update CORS origins to include production backend URLs
2. Remove localhost origins from production CORS settings for security
3. Ensure all services are deployed with consistent CORS policies

---
**Issue Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Deployment**: Vercel frontend can now communicate with local services
**Date**: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}
