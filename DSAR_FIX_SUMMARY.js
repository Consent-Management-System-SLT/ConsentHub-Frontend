// DSAR Request Issue Resolution Summary
// =====================================

/* 
PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Customer dashboard DSAR requests were failing with 400 (Bad Request) errors
- Frontend was sending: { type: 'export', reason: 'Test', additionalDetails: 'Test' }
- Backend was expecting: { type: 'data_access', description: 'Test' }
- Two main issues:
  1. Field name mismatch: 'reason' vs 'description'
  2. Enum value mismatch: 'export' not in DSARRequest schema enum

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Added request type mapping in backend (comprehensive-backend.js):
   - 'export' â†’ 'data_access'
   - 'delete' â†’ 'data_erasure'
   - 'correct' â†’ 'data_rectification'
   - etc.

2. Added field handling for both frontend formats:
   - description = reason || description || "No description provided"
   - Combined reason + additionalDetails into full description

3. Enhanced error handling and logging

TESTING RESULTS:
âœ… Export requests: 'export' â†’ 'data_access' âœ“
âœ… Delete requests: 'delete' â†’ 'data_erasure' âœ“
âœ… Customer names properly resolved: "Pramodh Silva" âœ“
âœ… Requests visible in CSR dashboard âœ“
âœ… End-to-end flow working âœ“

FILES MODIFIED:
- comprehensive-backend.js (DSAR endpoint mapping and field handling)

VERIFIED WORKING:
- Customer can submit DSAR requests from dashboard âœ“
- Requests are stored in MongoDB with proper enum values âœ“
- CSR dashboard displays requests with customer names âœ“
- Both 'export' and 'delete' request types work âœ“
