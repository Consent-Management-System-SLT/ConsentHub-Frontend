# Vercel Not Deploying Latest Commits - Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Reasons & Solutions

### 1. **Auto-Deploy is Disabled**
**Check:** Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
- ✅ Ensure "Auto-deploy" is enabled
- ✅ Check if correct branch is set for auto-deploy

### 2. **Build Failed on Previous Commit** 
**Check:** Vercel Dashboard → Deployments tab
- ❌ If last deployment failed, Vercel stops auto-deploying
- **Solution:** Fix build errors and push again

### 3. **GitHub Integration Issues**
**Check:** Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git
- ✅ GitHub connection status
- **Solution:** Reconnect if needed: Settings → Git → "Disconnect" → "Connect Git Repository"

### 4. **Branch Mismatch**
**Check:** Which branch Vercel is watching
- Vercel might be watching `main` but you pushed to `master` (or vice versa)
- **Solution:** Settings → Git → Change "Production Branch"

### 5. **No Changes Detected**
**Check:** Your last commit
- If only config files changed, Vercel might skip deployment
- **Solution:** Make a small code change and push

### 6. **Webhook Issues**
**Check:** GitHub Settings → Webhooks
- Look for Vercel webhook errors
- **Solution:** Delete and reconnect in Vercel

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Force Manual Deploy
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Click "Deployments"**  
3. **Click "Deploy" button**
4. **Select latest commit manually**

### Trigger New Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change and push
echo "// Force deploy" >> src/App.tsx
git add .
git commit -m "Force Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Check Build Status
```bash
# In your local project
npm run build
# Should complete without errors
```

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard
- Go to your project in Vercel
- Check "Deployments" tab for errors
- Look at build logs for failed deployments

### 2. Check GitHub Webhooks
- GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks
- Should see Vercel webhook with ✅ green checkmark

### 3. Verify Branch
- Ensure you pushed to the correct branch
- Check Vercel is watching the right branch

### 4. Test Local Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Most Likely Issue
Based on your recent changes, it's probably:
1. **Build failure** from the vite.config.ts changes
2. **Branch mismatch** - check which branch Vercel is watching
3. **Auto-deploy disabled** after a failed build

## Quick Solution
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard** for build errors
2. **Manual deploy** if auto-deploy is stuck
3. **Push a small change** to trigger new deployment

Let me know what you see in your Vercel dashboard!
