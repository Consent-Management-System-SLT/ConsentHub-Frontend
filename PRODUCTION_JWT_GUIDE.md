/**
 * JWT Production Flow Documentation
 * 
 * Your JWT tokens will work identically in production as they do locally.
 * Here's the exact flow:
 */

// 1. USER REGISTRATION (Frontend → Backend)
// URL: https://consent-management-system-api.vercel.app → https://consenthub-backend.onrender.com
const registrationFlow = {
  frontend: "User fills signup form",
  apiCall: "POST https://consenthub-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/register",
  backend: "Creates user in MongoDB Atlas + generates JWT",
  response: "Returns JWT token + user data",
  storage: "Token stored in localStorage"
};

// 2. USER LOGIN (Frontend → Backend)
const loginFlow = {
  frontend: "User fills login form", 
  apiCall: "POST https://consenthub-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/auth/login",
  backend: "Validates credentials + generates JWT",
  response: "Returns JWT token + user data",
  storage: "Token stored in localStorage"
};

// 3. AUTHENTICATED REQUESTS (Frontend → Backend)
const authenticatedFlow = {
  frontend: "Include JWT in Authorization header",
  apiCall: "Any API call with 'Bearer <jwt-token>'",
  backend: "Validates JWT + processes request",
  response: "Returns requested data",
  security: "JWT verified on every request"
};

// 4. CUSTOMER DASHBOARD (Profile Display)
const dashboardFlow = {
  frontend: "Customer logs in successfully",
  apiCall: "GET https://consenthub-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/customer/dashboard/profile",
  headers: "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>",
  backend: "Decodes JWT → finds user → returns profile",
  display: "User sees their profile data"
};

/**
 * Why JWT works seamlessly in production:
 * 
 * ✅ Stateless: No server-side sessions to maintain
 * ✅ Cross-domain: Works between Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)
 * ✅ Secure: Signed tokens prevent tampering
 * ✅ Scalable: No shared state between servers
 * ✅ Same Database: MongoDB Atlas accessible from anywhere

console.log("🎉 JWT Authentication will work perfectly in production!");
console.log("📱 Users can register, login, and access their dashboard");
console.log("🔐 All authentication flows are production-ready");
console.log("🌐 CORS properly configured for cross-origin requests");
console.log("💾 MongoDB Atlas handles data persistence");
